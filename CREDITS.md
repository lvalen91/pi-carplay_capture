# Credits

As always, this is not the effort of a single person. Many thanks to everyone who
has contributed, tested, reported issues, and provided feedback —
especially to those who initially explored and experimented with this concept.

This project was inspired by and informed through various open-source projects,
experiments, and community efforts in the CarPlay / Carlinkit ecosystem.

The following projects were valuable references, inspiration, or learning resources
during development.
